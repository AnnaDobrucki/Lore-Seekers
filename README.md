# Lore Seekers 

Welcome to the world of DnD workshops run by Lore Seekers - [you can find the live version here.]() 

The website allows users with easy access to any and all potential workshops they may be curious about. This is aimed at people of all ages who are wanting to be creative and put themselves out there for a role-playing game that at times can feel overwhelming. 

## Project Goals

Understanding this feeling of being overwhelmed, it was imperative to make the website as eye-catching, simple and easy to use as possible.
Knowing the world of Dungeons & Dragons as I do, it is easy to feel like there are ‘gatekeepers’ to the subject, and it comes with a heavily introverted society. To counter this I created a website that;
- Has bite sized and direct tidbits of information.
- Provides essential info regarding the various workshops.
- Easy to find sign up form, which is quick and straight forward.
- Has outreach for a variety of people over multiple spectrums.
- Guides the user to where these workshops would take place.  

### Features

Through-out the website there are call’s to action to guide the user to find out more about the workshops, and eventually sign up for one of them. 

I did this by creating a Nav bar that allows the user to know where they are at all times through-out there use.
Embedding links to each workshops, in the Home section.
As well as links to the _Join Us_ page.

I also created a footer bar. 
Consisting of two blocks, one that allows the user to Contact Us for any further info. The other a Visit Us to all the relevant social media links for Lore Seekers. 

 ### Design
   1. Color Scheme.
    - Although Dungeons and Dragons are well known for there black and reds, I wanted a color scheme that was tangental to its original. I used [*My Color.Space*](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23EA0661&sub=1) to generate a color scheme that worked for me. Playing around with pinks/ blues and whites. With the addition of gold to really stand out and help for accessability users.

   2. Fonts.
    - Again the Font of most DnD books or stories has its own well renowned font (even used for the title credit of Stranger Things), so I wanted to steer clear of copywrite probelms and make something less harsh, and preferably enjoyable to read. Thanks to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I managed to have both a bold font for important information, and a lighter weighted one of Josefin-Sans that has a more fantastical nature to it. 

   3. Wireframes.
    - I constructed the page idea in my head and placed it on paper at first, which I then transposed onto a wireframe. 
    To help me visualise my website before I got to coding I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiAwomeBhBWEiwAM43YIKDLVpSTbTPGdANYmNtCBIQFrCBalOw9J1Hy3rXIXJycnkIxDYr8ahoCwtEQAvD_BwE).
    However I only made the index page with this, after I created it I ran straight into creating the site itself and never came back to play around with the ideas for other pages. I believe would be something I take under more consideration in future.
