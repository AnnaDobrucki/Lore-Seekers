# Lore Seekers

Welcome to the world of DnD workshops run by Lore Seekers - [you can find the live version here.]() 

This website allows users with easy access to any and all potential workshops they may be curious about. This is aimed at people of all ages who are wanting to be creative and put themselves out there for a role-playing game that at times can feel overwhelming. 

## Project Goals

Understanding this feeling of being overwhelmed, it was imperative to make the website as eye-catching, simple and easy to use as possible.
Knowing the world of Dungeons & Dragons as I do, it is easy to feel like there are ‘gatekeepers’ to the subject, and it comes with a heavily introverted society. To counter this I created a website that;
- Has bite sized and direct tidbits of information.
- Provides essential info regarding the various workshops.
- Easy to find sign up form, which is quick and straight forward.
- Has outreach for a variety of people over multiple spectrums.
- Entices newcomers without fear, shows knowledge for those coming with more experience. 
- Guides the user to where these workshops would take place.  

## Features

I enacted multiple features to help streamline user experience on this site. Through-out the website there are call’s to action to guide the user to find out more about the workshops, and eventually sign up for one of them. 

+ Nav Bar 
  * I did this by creating a Nav bar that allows the user to know where they are at all times through-out there use.
  Embedding links to each workshops, in the Home section.
  As well as links to the _Join Us_ page.

+ Landing Page
  * The landing page has a bold hero image and a one use animation for cover text, this was used as an eyecatching feature so the first element users read is about *workshops* and *DnD*. In addition for better user expereience I created workshop badges that you begin to see at the bottom of the screen, so the user can infer that there is more content below.

+ Workshops Page
  * After the landing page most links are heading towards the workshops page. Here there are a multitude of YouTube Videos, and "short and sweet" breakdowns of each workshop, and there affiliated time slots. I added the videos with the forethought, that newcomers would like to have some basic knowledge about DnD before entering a new space, with new people. Linking those pages are embedded links to the Join.In page.

    * [Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANdG2DGm0CQ)

+ Join In Page 
  * Here users are greeted with a simple yet effective sign up sheet, making calls to action to fill in required fields, that, if not fully completed the page will not _Submit_ there choices. 

+ Thank You page 
  * This was in fact reccomeneded by my mentor Gareth McGirr. My original idea had the PUSH action to a code institute form-dump page. However under the suggestion of my mentor, I created a page that greets the user with a Thank you, and D20 image (well known as a good omen in DnD). This allows the user to still remain on my site instead of being push somehwere else. 
  
+ Footer
  * I also created a footer bar. Consisting of two blocks, one that allows the user to Contact Us for any further info. The other a Visit Us to all the relevant social media links for Lore Seekers. I also inserted a [Google Maps iframe straight to the workshops venue.](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=51.495359,-0.099585&z=15&t=m&hl=en&gl=GB&mapclient=embed&cid=3226506455862106501)

 ### Design
   1. Color Scheme.
    - Although Dungeons and Dragons are well known for there black and reds, I wanted a color scheme that was tangental to its original. I used [*My Color.Space*](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23EA0661&sub=1) to generate a color scheme that worked for me. Playing around with pinks/ blues and whites. With the addition of gold to really stand out and help for accessability users.

   2. Fonts.
    - Again the Font of most DnD books or stories has its own well renowned font (even used for the title credit of Stranger Things), so I wanted to steer clear of copywrite probelms and make something less harsh, and preferably enjoyable to read. Thanks to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I managed to have both a bold font for important information, and a lighter weighted one of Josefin-Sans that has a more fantastical nature to it. 

   3. Wireframes.
    - I constructed the page idea in my head and placed it on paper at first, which I then transposed onto a wireframe. 
    To help me visualise my website before I got to coding I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiAwomeBhBWEiwAM43YIKDLVpSTbTPGdANYmNtCBIQFrCBalOw9J1Hy3rXIXJycnkIxDYr8ahoCwtEQAvD_BwE).
    However I only made the index page with this, after I created it I ran straight into creating the site itself and never came back to play around with the ideas for other pages. I believe would be something I take under more consideration in future.
